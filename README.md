# JE-808rev2
Tube screamer emulator plugin built in ASPIK plugin framework. Follow up to my original JE-808 plugin built in JUCE..

You will need to run cmake on the project in the same fashion as any other ASPIK project. Once built you will need to drag the filters.h, fxobjects.h and fxobjects.cpp files
from the Plugin Kernel folder into the Xcode or VS project.
